Hi people,

I am Rohan
I am going to take your class today


We'll start by 8:10-15

- Revision of React Hooks
- useContext & useReducer
- Redux Intro 

## useState
Input - Default value
Output - A variable & a func which can change the variable

## useEffect
1. No dependency passed - Infinite rendering(Reruns on every render)
2. An empty array is passed as the dependency array - Only on initial render
3. props or state values are passed

## useRef
- The useRef hook allows us to persist values between renders
- It does not cause re-renders
- Can be used a DOM element directly (e.g. inputElementRef.focus)
